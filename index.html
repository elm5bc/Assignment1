		<h2>America's Highways and Cities</h2>
		<div id='info-window-body'>
			<p>In 1956 the Federal Aid Highway Act was approved, laying the legislative groundwork for an interstate transportation system which acutely changed the American city. The idea and main proponent of the interstate highway system was then President Dwight D. Eisenhower. During WWII Eisenhower saw Germanyâ€™s Autobahn as part of a successful defense strategy. The highway system was proposed primarily as a defense system for the U.S. A system which could transport troops quickly across the country, as well as evacuate citizens rapidly in the event of an emergency.  
</p>
			<p>
			Under the act states could propose a highway, and if accepted the federal government would pay for 90 percent of the cost. Eisenhower never envisioned the highway system running through cities. Rather the highway was to connect cities state to state. However the oversite was left to the states and most proposals chose to run highways through the city rather than around.
